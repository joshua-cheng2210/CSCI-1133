Purpose: a function that does a weighted random selection from the keys of a dictionary, using the values as the weights.
Parameter(s): dict: a dictionary of options as keys and weights as values
Return Value: return a value base on it's weight

Purpose:
    creating a dictionary representing the vote counts for a specific office
Parameter(s):
    district should be the name of a file containing all voting data for a given district, in the format specified above.
    office should be the name of one of the column titles present in the CSV file.  You can assume that the office passed in will match one of the columns in the CSV file.  
Return Value:
